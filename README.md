Code used for my research in DNA Coding Theory

01 - Code used to count the number of strands partitioned by the size of their largest reverse-complement.

02 - Small collection of functions that calculate the girth of a graph using a BFS algorithm and the creation of graphs for spatially-coupled codes based on a base graph and forwarded edges.
